**Sales and Revenue Analytics and Forecasting for Strategic Business Insights**

**Project Description:**

This project utilizes machine learning and time series analysis to gain strategic business insights from sales and revenue data. The primary goals were to predict monthly units sold, forecast monthly revenue, and analyze the relationship between unit price and revenue across different product categories to identify optimal price points.

**Dataset:**
The analysis is based on a dataset containing detailed sales transactions, including customer demographics, location, product information, quantity, unit cost, unit price, cost, and revenue. The dataset underwent a comprehensive data pipeline including acquisition, type checking, handling duplicates and outliers, and filling missing values.

**Objectives and Findings:**
**1. Predict Monthly Units Sold (Objective 1):**
**Methodology:** Several regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor) were attempted using historical features including lagged monthly quantities and the number of unique countries.
**Findings:** The models did not achieve the target R² score of 0.85. The limited historical data (16 months for this specific analysis) was identified as a significant constraint on the predictive performance of standard regression models.
**Conclusion:** Achieving a higher accuracy for predicting monthly units sold requires more extensive historical data or potentially exploring more advanced time series forecasting techniques.

**2. Time Series Forecasting for Monthly Revenue (Objective 2):**
**Methodology:** An ARIMA (1, 1, 0) model was implemented to forecast monthly revenue for the next 12 months.
**Findings:** A 12-month forecast was generated. However, the reliability of the estimates is limited by the small historical dataset (19 months). The model diagnostics also indicated potential issues with assumption violations due to data limitations. The forecast shows a relatively flat trend, which may not fully capture future growth or seasonality.
**Conclusion:** While time series forecasting is feasible, obtaining more historical data is crucial for improving forecast accuracy and the reliability of the model.

**3. Unit Price and Revenue Analysis by Product Category (Objective 3):**
**Methodology:** The relationship between Unit Price and Revenue was analyzed and visualized using scatter plots for different product categories (Accessories, Bikes, Clothing).
**Findings:** The analysis revealed that Bikes show a strong positive correlation between higher unit prices and higher total revenue, indicating that high-value bike sales are a key revenue driver. For Accessories and Clothing, the relationship was less clear from this aggregated view.
**Conclusion:** Identifying precise "optimal" price points requires more in-depth analysis, potentially involving price binning, demand elasticity modeling, and profit analysis, which were beyond the scope of this initial visualization.

**Real-World Insights and Recommendations:**
**Prioritize High-Value Products:** Focus strategic efforts on the Bikes category, as it is the primary revenue generator.
**Invest in Data Collection:** To improve the accuracy of predictive modeling and time series forecasting, prioritize collecting consistent and comprehensive sales data over a longer period.
**Refine Pricing Strategies:** Conduct more detailed analysis for Accessories and Clothing to optimize pricing for either revenue or profit, potentially through price testing or granular data analysis.
**Leverage Geographical Strengths:** Maintain a strong focus on key markets like the United States and explore opportunities in other significant revenue-contributing countries.
**Targeted Marketing:** Utilize customer demographic insights from the EDA to inform targeted marketing campaigns.

**Addressing the Original Problem:**
This project successfully applied data analysis and modeling techniques to gain valuable insights into sales and revenue patterns, addressing the initial problem of providing strategic business insights. While data limitations impacted the achievement of the R² target for unit sales prediction, the analysis provided actionable insights into product performance, market dynamics, and the importance of data collection for future forecasting and strategic decision-making.
